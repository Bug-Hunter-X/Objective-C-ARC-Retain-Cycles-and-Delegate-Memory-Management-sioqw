In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider the scenario where a class retains an object, but fails to release it when it's no longer needed, creating a retain cycle.  This might manifest as unexpectedly high memory usage or crashes.  Another example is improper handling of delegate objects, such as not releasing them in dealloc or when they are no longer needed. This may cause unexpected behavior or app crashes.  Furthermore, misuse of `copy` or `mutableCopy` with properties can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the property is not properly managed.

Example of a retain cycle:

```objectivec
@interface ClassA : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) ClassB *b;
@end

@interface ClassB : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) ClassA *a;
@end

@implementation ClassA
// ...
@end

@implementation ClassB
// ...
@end
```

In this case, ClassA strongly retains ClassB, and ClassB strongly retains ClassA, creating a retain cycle.
