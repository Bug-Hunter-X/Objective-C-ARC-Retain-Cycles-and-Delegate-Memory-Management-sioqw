The solution addresses the retain cycle by using `weak` references where appropriate, breaking the circular dependency. For delegate management, it ensures that the delegate is released when it is no longer required, typically in the `dealloc` method or when the delegate is set to `nil`.

```objectivec
@interface ClassA : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) ClassB *b;
@end

@interface ClassB : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) ClassA *a;
@end

@implementation ClassA
// ...
@end

@implementation ClassB
- (void)dealloc {
    _a = nil; // release the reference
}
@end
```

This revised code breaks the retain cycle.  Proper delegate management involves similar practices, releasing the delegate reference when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
